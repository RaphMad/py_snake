## Introduction

This project contains a simple Snake game implementation based on [PyGame](https://https://www.pygame.org/).

The project is not tailored towards any specific IDE, although I personally used **Visual Studio Code** with its **Python** plugin.

## Build

* Make sure [Pipenv](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is set up for your python installation.
* Install requirements with `pipenv install`

## Run

* Execute the main file **main.py** within **Pipenv** by running `pipenv run python main.py`
* Note that most IDEs come with their own means of executing python files.

## License

MIT, see **LICENSE** file.
